# Identification-and-detection-of-Fake-News-on-Online-Social-Networks
A research report on the Identification-and-detection-of-Fake-News-on-Online-Social-Networks

## Abstract
During the 2016 US presidential election, the phrase “fake news” found its way to the
forefront in news articles, tweets, and fiery online debates the world over after misleading and
untrue stories proliferated rapidly. Social networks are very useful and a focal part of our life and
day to day communication since they provide us with an ideal platform for keeping up to date
with the latest information, news, activities happening across the world based on our interests
and profiles we like/follow and people we add/follow. However, because of the openness and
freedom of speech social networks such as Twitter and Facebook are also proving to be a fertile
ground for spreading fake news and due to the mass of public that is connected on these social
networks enables the information to diffuse and reach a large number of people in a short span of
time. The spreading of fake news on social networks, especially in times of disaster, or on
matters involving national security brings unwanted effects on the lives of individuals and
societies. The main aim of this report is to understand the fake news problems, it’s possible
adverse effects on consumers and to determine the most common features of fake news on social
networks whether that is content of its propagation. The results of this study will, later on, be
used to find out improvements in the currently existing approaches or devise a brand new
strategy to combat the problem of fake news. We studied over 20 research papers on the
identification and detection of fake news on social networks and analyzed their approaches and
datasets used. We came to the conclusion that the approaches used for the identification of fake
news on social networks can be broadly divided into three main categories, listing the most
prominent aspects in each category i.e based on content, social context, and propagation.

## Introduction
The use of social networks has rapidly changed the way people communicate and access
news and information online. Social networks connect a large number of users distributed across
different regions all over the world, with Facebook alone having more than 2.23 billion MAUs.
Twitter with 335 million MAUs. Social networks like Twitter and Facebook provide a medium
which enables people to influence each other’s decisions on important issues such as health,
shopping, traveling, and professional concerns.

While social networks are mostly used for communicating, they are also being used to
share news on current affairs and other important information. Now more than ever, people rely
on social networks as a source of news. For example, at any point in time, 85% of the trending
topics on Twitter is related to news on current affairs. Unfortunately, there are people who
misuse social networks by spreading fake news, rumors and propagating misinformation.

Fake news is news whose context has been intentionally changed and manipulated in
order to influence the readers’ opinions on facts of the events taking place in the real world

The problem addressed is the explosive growth of Fake news is news whose context has
been intentionally changed and manipulated in order to influence the readers’ opinions on facts
of the events taking place in the real world and its erosion to democracy, justice, and public trust.
As the quote says "Falsehood flies and the truth comes limping after it" and in this regard,
several algorithms and models have been proposed even a Fake News Challenge is conducted
every year for developing models and algorithms for the identification and eradication of fake
news on the internet. The best performing so far are CNN and RNN based models achieving an
unprecedented accuracy of 83.4%
In order to track the spread of hoaxes a model was proposed by Tambuscio that uses the
following four parameters: spreading rate, gullibility, the probability to verify a hoax, and
forgetting one's current belief. Now on average, almost every organization employ social media
accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for the purposes of announcing corporate
information such as earnings reports and new product releases to get maximum reach.
Consumers, investors, and other stakeholders take these news messages as seriously as they
would for any other mass media.
